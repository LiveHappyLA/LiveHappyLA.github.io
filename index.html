			<p> At LiveHappyLA our mission is simple, we are committed to helping you find your happy place. We know, all too well -- that life happens. Our commitment to our clients is helping you find the right house to deal with everyting that is happening in your life. Real Estate isn't just about what you can or can't afford, yes -- those play an obvious factor. But we use the equation of where you are in life and what you want out of life. Are you just starting out? Looking for your first home? Maybe you travel a lot and owning something that can be rented out as an investmentrent makes sense financially and logistically. Perhaps you commute a lot for work, and when you are home you don't feel like driving, therefore need a walking lifestyle. Crazy ex that you need a low key spot away from?!? Whatever your unique situaiton is - we'll figure it out together and find the best place that will make you happy. </p>
